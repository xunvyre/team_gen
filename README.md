Module 10 Challenge

## Purpose
Illustrate an understanding of Inquirer, Node.js, and the Jest testing suite while creating a marketable product for later usage.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* ES6
* Node.js
* Inquirer
* Jest

## Future Development
I would like to add validation to the Inquirer prompts, as well as custom icons. Since this was not a requirement for the project, these things were omitted to save time.
